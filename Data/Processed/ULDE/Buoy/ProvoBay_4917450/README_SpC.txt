The data looks reasonable from 4/8 to 8/24/20 when we had to pull the buoy b/c the wsel was too low.  On 9/1 we installed a stndalone sonde to keep measuring parameters.  From 9/1 to the end of the deployment for the year I can't explain what is happening other than hardware malfunction, or the sonde is in the bed surface of the bay??  I'll let the PI analyst keep or delete.
